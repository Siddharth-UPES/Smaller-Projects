# 🎓 UPES Students Feedback Survey Form

This is a basic HTML-only project that simulates a student feedback survey form for the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES). It is designed for front-end demonstration purposes using only **HTML** — no JavaScript or backend.

## 📁 Project Structure
  Basic Survey Report/
  ├── survey_Form.html # Main feedback form
  ├── Thank.html # Thank you page (redirected after the submission)
  ├── UPES-Logo-without-Tagline.jpg # University logo (shown on form)

## 📝 Features

- Fully static HTML-based form
- Clean UI with UPES branding
- Rating-based questions
- Facility usage checkboxes
- Department preference and satisfaction scale
- Suggestions section
- Confirmation checkbox before submission
- Redirects to a custom thank-you page

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the `.html` files.
2. Make sure all files (`survey_Form.html`, `Thank.html`, and the logo image) are in the same folder.
3. Open `survey_Form.html` in any web browser.
4. Fill in the form and submit — it will open `Thank.html` in a new tab as a confirmation page.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
